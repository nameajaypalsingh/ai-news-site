They’re publishing these notes on X, in blog posts, or in the case of one former OpenAI safety researcher by writing a [full _New York Times_ op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/opinion/openai-ads-chatgpt.html).\n\nI’ve been dying to really dig in and try to unpack what’s going on with all these talent moves in AI. So my guest today is _Verge_ senior AI reporter Hayden Field, who’s been covering the revolving door of the AI industry really closely and also the broader culture that’s motivating the AI workers to jump ship and the companies that are ruthlessly trying to hire them.\n\nThose motivations vary. Sure, all these people are paid extravagant salaries, but as you’ll hear Hayden say, a stronger motivating force is ideology and mission. The people working on AI, by and large, believe that what they’re doing is going to radically change the world, and they’re not really in desperate need of more money. So that really changes the incentive structures that might push people to leave, say, OpenAI for Anthropic, or to [quit Elon Musk’s xAI](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/878761/mass-exodus-at-xai-grok-elon-musk-restructuring) now that it’s been acquired by SpaceX.\n\nAt the same time, the incentives of the AI companies themselves are going from raising money to making money. Reporting suggests OpenAI and maybe even Anthropic [could go public this year,](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-ipo-anthropic-race-69f06a42) and doing so would create a historic amount of wealth. It would also put new kinds of pressure on these companies to be more transparent about how they spend money and to be much more accountable for returning on the huge investments that they’ve raised so far.\n\nThere’s a lot in this conversation. The AI industry right now is full of drama. There’s big characters, bitter rivalries, lots of money, and really, really long blog posts about the end of the world.\n\n_If you’d like to read more about what we discussed in this episode, check out these links:_\n\n*   What’s behind the mass exodus at xAI? | [_The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/878761/mass-exodus-at-xai-grok-elon-musk-restructuring)\n*   OpenClaw founder Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI | [_The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/879623/openclaw-founder-peter-steinberger-joins-openai)\n*   Two more xAI co-founders leave after the SpaceX merger | [_The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/877609/two-more-xai-co-founders-are-among-those-leaving-after-the-spacex-merger)\n*   AI safety leader says ‘world is in peril’ and quits to study poetry | [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62dlvdq3e3o)\n*   OpenAI is making the mistakes Facebook made.
